![Headlights in Action][2]

Headlights adds a `Bundles` menu to Vim, revealing your bundles (aka. plugins)
and the features they provide.

Headlights creates a menu for each _currently loaded_ bundle, grouping
together docs, commands, mappings, abbreviations, functions, and script files.

Combined with a powerful bundle manager, Headlights will improve your ~~Vim
user experience~~ quality of life.

![Headlights in Action][2]

Headlights adds a `Bundles` menu to Vim, revealing your bundles (aka. plugins)
and the features they provide.

Headlights creates a menu for each _currently loaded_ bundle, grouping together
docs, commands, mappings, abbreviations, functions, highlights, and plugin
files.

Combined with a powerful bundle manager, Headlights will improve your ~~Vim
user experience~~ quality of life.

Protip
------

If you use Mac OS X, you can quickly access any plugin by typing its name. For
example, hit `CMD-?` to bring up a search dialog for menu items, then type
`fugitive open` to reveal the `fugitive.vim` file as the first result. You can
also type `fugitive help` to quickly access the documentation. I do this, like,
_all the time_.

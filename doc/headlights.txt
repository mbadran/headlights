INTRODUCTION                                                *headlights-intro*

Headlights adds a 'bundles' menu [1] to Vim, revealing your bundles [2] and
the features they provide.

Headlights creates a menu for each currently loaded [3] bundle, grouping
together docs, commands, mappings, abbreviations, functions, and script files.

Combined with a powerful bundle manager, Headlights will improve your Vim user
experience -- nay, your Quality of Life.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1]: Headlights is inspired by TextMate's 'Bundles' menu.

[2]: Aka. plugins.

[3]: Headlights mirrors Vim's 'scriptnames' command, revealing only the
     bundles that are currently loaded. This is fast because it avoids file
     system access, but the trade off is that autoload bundles are not
     revealed until they are, well, autoloaded. (This is acceptable.)

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                   *headlights-options*

Note: For performance reasons, only 'commands' and 'mappings' are enabled by
default. See |headlights-issues| for details.

                                                  *headlights_use_plugin_menu*

Reuse the conventional 'plugin' menu instead of creating a new one: >

    let g:headlights_use_plugin_menu = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                       *headlights_show_files*

Create menus for bundles' script files: >

    let g:headlights_show_files = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                    *headlights_show_commands*

Create menus for bundles' commands: >

    let g:headlights_show_commands = 1
<
Default value: 1

                                                    *headlights_show_mappings*

Create menus for bundles' mappings: >

    let g:headlights_show_mappings = 1
<
Default value: 1

                                               *headlights_show_abbreviations*

Create menus for bundles' abbreviations: >

    let g:headlights_show_abbreviations = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                   *headlights_show_functions*

Create menus for bundles' global functions: >

    let g:headlights_show_functions = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                       *headlights_debug_mode*

Enable debug mode and create menus to access the log file: >

    let g:headlights_debug_mode = 1
<
Default value: 0 (1 in the event of a Headlights exception)

Note: If you manually enable this option, remember to disable it after
troubleshooting, or log files will be generated very time you enter a buffer,
impacting performance and disk space.

==============================================================================
ISSUES                                                     *headlights-issues*

When |headlights_debug_mode| is enabled -- either because you enabled it or
because a critical error occurred -- a 'debug' menu will appear in the
Headlights menu. This will give you access to the Headlights debug log, which
has all the information needed to troubleshoot any problems.

In the event of a problem, please raise a new project issue at:

<https://github.com/mbadran/headlights/issues>

Be sure to reference the debug log. You can upload it to paste services like
<http://pastebin.com>.

Lastly, I welcome any pull requests, so feel free to Fork, Fix, Send.

GENERAL ISSUES

- Performance, or lack thereof.

Headlights can slow Vim down when a large number of bundles are loaded, or
when hardware resources are limited. Because of this, most Headlights options
are disabled by default.

If you experience slowness when launching Vim or switching buffers, disable
some or all Headlights options, and consider troubleshooting further or
raising a project issue.

- Syntax items? What syntax items?

Syntax items are not currently revealed by Headlights. This is because Vim
does not reveal the source of syntax items (ie :verbose syntax), so there is
no way to refer syntax items back to a bundle. This is unfixable, unless Vim
introduces this functionality in a later version.

For all other issues, refer to <https://github.com/mbadran/headlights/issues>

TODO                                                         *headlights-todo*

- the bundles menu currently gets out of order when autoload bundles are
  handled. this is because the menu is not entirely reset -- only new items
  are added below. to fix this, either provide a command to redo all the
  menus, have a periodic on timeout fix, or change the menu layout to submenus
  only (which is uglier and less convenient).

- more performance optimisation on the default settings

- more testing, especially for linux and windows

MAYBE

- group bundles by parent. vim does not currently do this, nor does
  headlights. see syntastic for an example.

  headlights can identify associated bundles if they share a common path, but
  this requires some checks, and a 'parent' field will probably have to be
  added to bundles. this may impact performance, and it should be optional.

- add a new bundle category: highlight (:verbose highlight)

- bring back autocmds as an optional bundle category (:verbose autocmd)

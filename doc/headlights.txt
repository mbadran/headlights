INTRODUCTION                                                *headlights-intro*

Headlights adds a 'bundles' menu [1] to Vim, revealing your bundles (aka.
plugins) and the features they provide.

Headlights creates a menu for each currently loaded [2] bundle, grouping
together docs, commands, mappings, abbreviations, functions, highlights, and
plugin files.

Combined with a powerful bundle manager, Headlights will improve your Vim user
experience -- nay, your quality of life.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1]: Headlights is inspired by TextMate's Bundles menu.

[2]: Headlights mirrors Vim's 'scriptnames' command, revealing only the
     bundles that are currently loaded. This is fast because it avoids file
     system access, but the trade off is that autoload bundles and ftplugins
     are not revealed until they are needed. (This is Good Enough ™.)

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                   *headlights-options*

Note: For performance reasons, only 'commands' and 'mappings' are enabled by
default. See |headlights-performance| for details.

                                                  *headlights_use_plugin_menu*

Reuse the conventional 'plugin' menu instead of creating a new one: >

    let g:headlights_use_plugin_menu = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                       *headlights_show_files*

                                                    *headlights_show_commands*

    let g:headlights_show_commands = 1
<
Default value: 1

                                                    *headlights_show_mappings*

Create menus for bundle mappings: >

    let g:headlights_show_mappings = 1
<
Default value: 1

                                               *headlights_show_abbreviations*

Create menus for bundle abbreviations: >

    let g:headlights_show_abbreviations = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                   *headlights_show_functions*

    let g:headlights_show_functions = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                  *headlights_show_highlights*

Create menus for bundle highlights: >

    let g:headlights_show_highlights = 1
<
Default value: 0

                                                  *headlights_show_load_order*

Create menus for load order of plugin files: >

    let g:headlights_show_load_order = 1
<
Default value: 0


                                                  *headlights_smart_menus*

Group bundles that share the same root together: >

    let g:headlights_smart_menus = 1
<
Default value: 1

                                                       *headlights_debug_mode*

Enable debug mode and create menus to access the log file: >

    let g:headlights_debug_mode = 1
<
Default value: 0 (1 in the event of a Headlights exception)

Note: If you manually enable this option, remember to disable it after
troubleshooting, or log files will be generated very time you enter a buffer,
impacting performance and disk space.

ISSUES                                                     *headlights-issues*

When |headlights_debug_mode| is enabled -- either because you enabled it or
because a critical error occurred -- a 'debug' menu will appear under the
Headlights menu. This will give you access to the Headlights debug log, which
has all the information needed to troubleshoot any problems.

In the event of a problem, please raise a new project issue at:

<https://github.com/mbadran/headlights/issues>

Be sure to reference the debug log in the issue or in a public Gist.

Lastly, I welcome any pull requests, so feel free to Fork, Fix, Send.

==============================================================================
PERFORMANCE                                           *headlights-performance*

Headlights can slow Vim down when a large number of bundles are loaded, or when
hardware resources are limited. This is mostly because adding menus to Vim is an
expensive operation which can take over half the total execution time.

This is why most configuration options are disabled by default.

If you experience slowness when launching Vim or switching buffers, disable some
or all configuration options, and consider troubleshooting further or raising a
project issue.

==============================================================================
TIPS                                                         *headlights-tips*

If you use Mac OS X, you can quickly access any bundle by typing its name. For
example, hit CMD-? to bring up a search dialog for menu items, then type
'fugitive open' to reveal the 'fugitive.vim' file as the first result. You can
also type 'fugitive help' to quickly access the documentation. I do this like,
_all the time_.
